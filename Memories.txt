An intense ache envelopes your neck. Your body goes numb for a moment, and then as quickly as the sensation came, it fades away, leaving you how you were before.
Sloth
mem2
The smell of burning rubber fills your nostrils and the sound of screeching tires deafen you. Chills run down your spine as your senses clear themselves of these sen-sations.
Envy
mem3
You close your eyes for a second, and as you open them you are blinded by a strong light, almost like staring directly at the sun. You close your eyes instinctively, and after a moment, you open them again and the light is gone.
Pride
mem4
Sirens slowly begin to fill the air. You hear voices chattering in a panicked tone. The sounds fill your mind and you can't think. You cup your ears, and suddenly the noise just stops. You wait for a moment to see if they come back. Nothing but the empty room meet your senses.
Lust
mem5
It begins to feel warm. Warmer. Very warm. Scolding. Your skin being to feel like its blistering as a burning sensation envelopes your entire body. You fall to the floor, writhing in pain. The sensation slowly fades away, leaving you in a puddle of your tears from the pain.
Wrath
mem6
As you leave the room, you feel what can only be described as the force of being thrown at a brick wall from a cannon. You double over in pain as your organs feel like they exploded. The sensation eventually leaves you, but could not have left soon enough.
Gluttony
mem7
It all becomes clear to you. All these random sensations you've been feeling after each of those monsters. This is all from what happened to you, that awful car crash from that oncoming car. The blinding light keeping you from avoiding it, the broken neck resulting from that terrible impact, the ensuing fire from the crash. You are about to die, and this is your last trial before your eternal fate is decided.
